# Engineering the Edge - Go & Systems

I focus on Go development: backend services, APIs, and crypto-exchange tooling.  
I approach engineering through structured learning, deep exploration, and a long-term mindset — growing toward the intersection of technology and business.

## What I Do
- Backend development with **Go**
- API design and integrations (REST/WebSocket)
- Network protocols and crypto-exchange tooling
- Automation tools for real-world workflows
- Clean architecture, patterns, and runtime internals

## Public Project
Most of my projects are private, but one open-source library is actively maintained:

### MEXC SDK for Go
A strongly typed Go SDK for interacting with the MEXC crypto exchange.  
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/IvanTurko/mexc-sdk-go)

- Clean, consistent API
- Suitable for bots, automation, and data collection
- Continuously improved and extended

## Interests
- Go architecture & design patterns  
- Performance and runtime behavior  
- Compilers & low-level internals  
- Crypto exchange systems & data flows  
- Developer tooling: nvim ❤️, Linux, Lua
